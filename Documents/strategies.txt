Some possible strategies:
-------------------------

Greedy          captures whenever possible
                else moves randomly? moves towards closest enemy? moves furthest-ahead piece?

Defensive       never moves (except knights?) only captures

Random          moves and captures randomly (only valid moves?)

Safe            never moves to a vulnerable cell, else moves/captures randomly

Coward	        passes every turn

Cheater/noob    always tries to make illegal moves

Slow march      advance all pieces in a group
                (always move furthest-back piece that has a valid move, else random)

Lazy knights    only move and capture with pawns

Stagger pawns   try to arrange pawns to protect each other
                (if pawn adjacent to another pawn, move 1 forward, else random?)
                like this:      x x x
                                 x x
